# Sale Call Engagement Analysis using Decision Tree model

Sales department at AdviseInvest is facing a problem where many of customers who scheduled a sales call does not answer the call.
We will clean data and then use a classification tree model to estimate the probability of customers answering sales call.
The result shows that the most important factors are customer income, and whether customer provided non‐mobile phone for follow‐up call. From the result, we could find customer segment likely to answer the call.
- customers with income > 39000, less than 2 accounts and 1 new car
- customers with income > 39000, more than 2 accounts.
- customers with income > 80000, providing no mobile for follow-up call and more than 1 saving account.
These are the target customers for whom AdviseInvest could develop a marketing strategy
